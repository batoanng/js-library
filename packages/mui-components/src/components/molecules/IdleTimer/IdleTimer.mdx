# IdleTimer

<Source language="ts" code={`import { IdleTimer } from "@batoanng/mui-components";`} />

## How to use this component

This component allows you to drop in a timer that when expired will perform a certain callback, typically used to logout a user after a certain amount of time.

You can pass in custom props to the component to change the default behavior, such as time until expiration, and the callback to perform when the timer expires.
