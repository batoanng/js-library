# Turborepo Design System starter with Changesets

This is an official React design system starter powered by Turborepo. Versioning and package publishing is handled by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and fully automated with GitHub Actions.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: A placeholder documentation site powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- `@batoanng/core`: core React components
- `@batoanng/utils`: shared React utilities
- `@batoanng/tsconfig`: shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `eslint-config-batoanng`: ESLint preset

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Versioning and Publishing packages

Package publishing has been configured using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Please review their [documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.

This example comes with automated npm releases setup in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action). To get this working, you will need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository settings. You should also install the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your GitHub repository as well.

For more information about this automation, refer to the official [changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/automating-changesets.md)

### npm

If you want to publish package to the public npm registry and make them publicly available, this is already setup.

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```

### GitHub Package Registry

See [Working with the npm registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package-using-publishconfig-in-the-packagejson-file)
